To build suxml, run `make && sudo make install`.

You can change a few variables in the Makefile:

 * NAME is the name of the program, suxml by default.
 * CC is the C++ compiler used, g++ by default, though clang++
   is also available.
 * INSTALL_PATH is the path to use when doing `make install`.
   /usr/local by default.

To build the Doxygen documentation, run `make doc`.
