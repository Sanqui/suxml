suxml is a simple yet usable, opinionated XML editor.

It was written in 2015 as semestral work for the subject BI-PA2.  You can read
the original assignment (in Czech) in the file zadani.txt.

Despite being written hastily over the course of a single weekend, I'm still
quite proud of it.  I didn't like the assignment, mostly because I often claim
to dislike XML itself - but it's not quite true.  I actually sort of like XML.
What I dislike is how it tends to be used - that is, for structured data,
where JSON or YAML fit the bill better, as opposed to simple markup of text.

Hence suxml's opinionated attitude.  suxml has a solid idea of how it wants
XML to look, and it won't let you break out of it.  This is a blessing and a
curse: in many cases, a XML file will be difficult or outright impossible
to edit sanely in suxml.  But if you hit the certain class of XML documents
suxml is fit for - you'll find it very useful and easy to use.
