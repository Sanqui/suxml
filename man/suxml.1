.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a simple yet usable, opinionated XML editor.
Its arguments are as follows.

.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -light
Invert the color scheme into black on white text.
.It Fl L
Do not include newline at the end of the file (for compatibility).
.It Fl P
Do not open the editor, only pass through the file.  suxml will reformat the
file, like a linter would.
.It Fl O Ar output_file
A different file to output to
.It Ar file
The XML file to edit.

.Sh AVAILABILITY
.Nm
should work on any system with a C++ compiler and the ncurses library.  It was
only tested on Linux, however.

.Sh EXAMPLES
It is simple to edit a XML file:
.Pp
.D1 $ suxml file.xml
.Pp

Maybe you prefer a light color scheme:
.Pp
.D1 $ suxml --light another_file.xml
.Pp

It's also possible to output to a different file, without a newline at the
end of the file:
.Pp
.D1 $ suxml -L -O mine/output.xml foreign/file.xml
.Pp

suxml can also be easily used as a linter, reformatting to its preferred format,
without opening the editor:
.Pp
.D1 $ suxml -P -O clean.xml dirty.xml
.Pp

.Sh BUGS
.Nm
currently has problems with XML structures nested too deep (i.e., wider than the terminal window).
